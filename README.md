This repository is an eclectic collection of optics, colorimetry, and image processing scripts written over the years.  Each targeted different projects, but I anticipate using/modifying these for future activities.

**Project 1**

This script models surface scattering properties assuming a collimated light source.  It assumes that a surface may be broken up in small segments, and that each segment is randomly assigned a slope.  The slopes are restricted by a gaussian distribution.  A surface roughness parameter may be adjusted by changing the distributions standard deviation.  The input parameters are (a) angle of incident, and (b) roughness parameter.  The graphic below shows the output of the script as the surface roughness is changed from smoothest (left) to rough (right).
